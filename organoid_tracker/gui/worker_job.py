"""A worker job is a job that is applied once to each experiment that is currently open in the GUI. It allows you to
collect some measurement, or make some change to each experiment. It is run on a worker thread, which avoids freezing
the GUI while images are being loaded. The job is applied to each experiment, and the results are passed back to the
GUI.

To get started, make a subclass of WorkerJob, and then call the submit_job function with an instance of your class.
