class Experiment:
    """A complete experiment, with many stacks of images collected over time. This class ultimately collects all
    details of the experiment.

    An experiment contains :class:`~organoid_tracker.core.position.Position` objects. They represent a cell detection
    at a particular time point. The object itself just stores an x, y, z and time point. The objects can be found in
    :code:`experiment.positions`. For example, to get a list of all positions at time point 7, use
    :code:`list(experiment.positions.of_time_point(TimePoint(7))`.

    Cell detections from different time points can be marked as belonging to the same biological cell. These links over
    time are stored in :code:`experiment.links`. Using for example :code:`experiment.links.find_futures(position)`,
    you'll know what  position in the next time point represents locates same cell. This will usually be one position,
    but in the case of a division, it will be two positions. In the case of a cell death, it will be 0 positions.

    Cells can also have neighbors, and those are defined in :code:`experiment.connections`. Metadata of cell positions,
    like the cell type or fluorescent intensity, is stored in :code:`experiment.position_data`.
