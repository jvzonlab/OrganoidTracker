================================================

[Publication of OrganoidTracker 1](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240802) / [Pre-print of OrganoidTracker 2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.11.617799)

Program for tracking cell nuclei in (intestinal) organoids over time. Uses a convolutional neural network for nucleus detection, a min-cost flow solver ([Haubold, 2016]) for linking nuclei over time and tools for manual error correction.


Nature Protocols 2025 edition
-----------------------------

This branch features a specialized edition of OrganoidTracker 2 (the Tensorflow version). It has [CellPhenTracker] pre-installed, which is the plugin used to measure intensities. In addition, it has a plugin pre-installed that defines mouse intestinal epithelial cell types, and can back-propagate them as described in [TypeTracker].

**This version of OrganoidTracker will not be updated with new features.** This edition allows user to closely follow the protocol as described in the paper. However, as the years will pass, this edition will slowly become more outdated, and may not support newly released graphics cards, image formats, tracking file formats, etc.


Features
--------

* Manual tracking/correction with live feedback.
* Automated cell center detection using a convolutional neural network based on U-net.
* Automated and accurate predictions of link and division probabilities using convolutional neural networks. 
* Automatically finding the most likely tracking solution using a min-cost flow solver ([Haubold, 2016])
* High confidence, context-aware, error probabilities for every link in a track to indicate the tracking quality. 
* Supports [TIFF files, TIFF series, Leica LIF files, Imaris IMS files, Zeiss CZI files and NIKON nd2 files](manuals/IMAGE_FORMATS.md).
* [Plugin API with live-reload for fast development](manuals/PLUGIN_TUTORIAL.md)

Intended workflow
-----------------
1. Do some manual tracking to obtain ground truth data and training data.
2. Train the neural networks.
3. Apply the automated tracker on some new time lapse movie.
4. Correct the errors in the tracking data of that time lapse movie.
5. Use the corrected tracking data as additional training data for the neural network.
6. Want to track another time lapse movie? Go back to step 3.

Installation
------------
OrganoidTracker must be installed using Anaconda. See the [installation] page for details. If you are updating from an older version of OrganoidTracker, its dependencies might have changed, and in that case you also need to visit the [installation] page.


Running the main program
------------------------
Open an Anaconda Prompt, activate the correct environment and navigate to the folder in which you installed OrganoidTracker.
The `organoid_tracker.py` script starts a graphical program that allows you to visualize and edit your data.


Reading the manual
------------------
After you have installed the software, please have a look at the [manual]. The manual is also available from the `Help` menu in the program; this works even when you're offline.

Pre-trained neural networks
---------------------------
* [Network trained for OrganoidTracker 2 (C elegans)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13912686) - trained using C elegans confocal data from the Cell Tracking Challenge
* [Network trained for OrganoidTracker 2 (organoid)](https://zenodo.org/records/13946119) - trained using our manually annotated intestinal organoid data

Example data
------------
Example intestinal organoid data is available with associated automated tracking results and can be used to try out the software. We have included the settings and executables used to generate the tracking results.
* [Example data organoid](https://zenodo.org/records/13982844) - 50 frames of intestinal organoid data

API
---
You can also use OrganoidTracker as a library to write your own scripts. All public functions in OrganoidTracker have docstrings to explain what they are doing. As a starting point for using the API, see the [API] page.

Using a Jupyter Notebook
------------------------
It's possible to use OrganoidTracker from Jupyter Notebooks. Just install the `notebook` conda package into your OrganoidTracker environment and everything should be ready. Detailed instructions to get you started are available at the [Jupyter] manual page.


Editing the source code
-----------------------
Install the program as normal, and then point your Python editor (PyCharm or Visual Studio Code are recommended) to this directory. Make sure to select the `organoid_tracker` Anaconda environment as the Python environment.
